<sub align="center">18/10/2023 - 21:00 - STATUS UPDATE</sub>

<strong> Identified </strong> - We're currently investigating further.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> There are currently two possible scenarios;
> - Discord has banned all Replit's server IPs from sending POST requests to the regular Discord API
> - Replit has banned all outgoing POST requests to Discord's API

> [!NOTE]
> While we are still unsure what is causing this, you can host your selfbots on different websites, VPS's or any other means of hosting.
